# nixos default version

if you hit 'd' you can set the 'default' version

if you aren't getting the 'latest' version

check if there is an arrow next to the version that is selected

if there is, hit 'd' again and then boot into any version

on next boot the latest will be chosen,

because there isn't a default set.

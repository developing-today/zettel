i'd like to be able to make a new page from the website, nothing as complex as #121, more an extension of the 'edit page' functionality that opens github/gitlab editor. i imagine a + icon that will make use <repo>/new/<branch>/<path> instead of using the /edit/ link like in the edit icon.

as a separate feature, possibly would be nice to have a quick way to make a new page in any folder, not just the current folder. i imagine some degree of interactivity for that, like how ctrl+k works but just for directories-- click 'new item dynamic' icon, type name of folder with autocomplete, then it drops you in github new page url for that path. this would be distinct from #84 because it would work entirely on the static page.

i believe github allows you to pre-populate the file name and even file contents in the 'new' url.

    <repo>/new/<branch><path>?filename=<filename>&value=<uri-encoded contents>

a yaml toggle to pre-populate markdown file with a zettlekasten date would be nice or maybe even a folgezettel id if it can be inferred.

could even populate a header based on the current file header/metadata.

but, to start a 'new file' button would be neat. :-)
